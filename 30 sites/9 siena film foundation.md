# Site 9: Siena Film Foundation

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://siena.film/](https://siena.film/)
- **Award**: Site of the Day (Mar 18, 2025)
- **Design/Dev**: [Niccolò Miranda](https://niccolomiranda.com/), G-NS Studio
- **Core Concept**: A high-end production house website that uses a "Film Strip" metaphor to showcase their cinematic projects. It blends classical film aesthetics with modern digital interactivity.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Timeless and cinematic. Uses a "Paper" or "Parchment" background (#FAF7EF) paired with deep black (#000000) typography. The aesthetic is inspired by vintage film credits and production company branding.
- **Film Strip Metaphor**: The core navigation is a horizontal "film strip" slider where each frame is a project.
- **Editorial Typography**: Uses elegant, high-contrast serif and sans-serif typefaces that feel both classic and contemporary.
- **Dynamic Menu**: A non-standard, procedural menu that rearranges itself based on user interaction, providing a sense of discovery.

## Animation & Interaction
- **Film Strip Slider**: A signature interaction where projects are dragged or scrolled horizontally, mimicking the movement of a film projector.
- **Brand Intro Animation**: A sophisticated loading sequence that establishes the brand's cinematic identity through kinetic typography and high-quality sound.
- **Contact Type Lettering**: An interactive contact section where the typography reacts to mouse movement, creating a playful but refined interaction.
- **Procedural Rearrangement**: Elements on the page (like the project slider) use procedural logic to rearrange themselves, ensuring a unique experience for every visitor.
- **Micro-interactions**: Every button and link has a deliberate, film-inspired animation, such as "ticket" shapes for the Enter button.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Core Engine**: **WebGL** for the complex slider transitions and procedural element placement.
- **Animation**: **GSAP (GreenSock)** for the master timelines and scroll-driven interactions.
- **Smooth Scroll**: **Lenis** for consistent, high-performance scrolling across devices.
- **Framework**: Custom React-based architecture (Niccolò Miranda often uses a highly optimized, custom React setup).
- **Audio**: Integrated spatial audio that reacts to user navigation and interactions.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **Thematic Metaphor**: Choose a core metaphor (like a film strip) and let it drive every design and interaction decision.
2. **Classical Elegance**: Use high-contrast, vintage-inspired aesthetics to create a sense of prestige and history.
3. **Procedural Interaction**: Move beyond standard grids by using procedural logic to rearrange elements, creating a "living" website.
4. **Cinematic Sound**: Don't underestimate the power of audio to enhance the "immersive" vibe of a site.
