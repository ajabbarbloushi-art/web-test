# Site 15: Paper Tiger Agency

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://papertiger.com/](https://papertiger.com/)
- **Award**: Multiple Awwwards SOTD/Honorable Mentions
- **Agency**: Paper Tiger
- **Core Concept**: A high-impact, strategy-first agency portfolio that balances bold editorial design with extreme technical efficiency. It serves as a masterclass in how to use "low-code" tools like Webflow to deliver "high-end" award-winning results.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Bold, confident, and editorial. Uses massive, high-contrast typography (black on white) to establish immediate authority. The "Clarity First, Impact Forever" mantra is reflected in the design's cleanliness.
- **Micro-Copy Focus**: Uses witty, sharp micro-copy (e.g., "0 scrubs," "infuriate their competition") to inject personality and "vibe" into a professional service site.
- **Modular Project Grid**: Showcases a diverse range of clients (from fintech like Betterment to non-profits like PBS) using a consistent, highly-polished grid system.
- **Stats as Design Elements**: Turns boring agency stats into a playful, interactive ticker or grid, making the agency's history feel dynamic.

## Animation & Interaction
- **Smooth Scroll & Lenis**: Uses **Lenis** for ultra-smooth scrolling, ensuring that the bold typography and large images move with a premium, weighted feel.
- **GSAP Interactions**: Subtle but precise entry animations for text and images, ensuring that content "arrives" exactly when the user needs it.
- **Hover States**: Highly refined hover effects on project cards and links that provide instant, high-quality feedback.
- **Kinetic Typography**: Large headings that shift or scale slightly on scroll, adding a sense of life to the static text.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Platform**: **Webflow**. A prime example of pushing Webflow to its absolute limits for award-winning design.
- **Smooth Scroll**: **Lenis** for consistent, high-performance scrolling.
- **Animation**: **GSAP (GreenSock)** for the more complex UI interactions and entry sequences.
- **Custom Code**: Extensive use of custom CSS and JS within Webflow to achieve non-standard layouts and interactions.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **Low-Code, High-Impact**: You don't always need a custom React/Next.js build to win Awwwards. A perfectly executed Webflow site with GSAP and Lenis can compete with the best.
2. **Personality Wins**: Use sharp, witty copy and "un-corporate" design elements to stand out to high-end clients who want something "different."
3. **Typography as Hero**: When your strategy is "clarity," let massive, beautiful typography be the primary visual driver of the site.
4. **Weighted Motion**: Use smooth scroll (Lenis) to give your site a "premium" feel that standard browser scrolling lacks.
