# Site 4: Locomotive Dynasty (2018-2023)

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://six.locomotive.ca/en/](https://six.locomotive.ca/en/)
- **Award**: Agency of the Year (6 consecutive years), Site of the Year Nominee
- **Agency**: [Locomotive](https://locomotive.ca/) (Montreal, Canada)
- **Core Concept**: A celebratory retrospective of the agency's "Dynasty" era, showcasing six years of dominance in the digital design industry through a high-performance, cinematic experience.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Bold, dark, and prestigious. Uses a "Gold Standard" theme (Black and Gold) to signify excellence and achievement.
- **Hero Section**: Features a high-quality video background (likely optimized with modern codecs) that captures the "Art of Teamwork."
- **Typography**: Uses bold, condensed grotesque typefaces that command attention and convey strength.
- **Layout**: Clean, structured, and focused on data (awards, stats). The "Six years in numbers" section uses an accordion-style reveal for detailed year-by-year statistics.

## Animation & Interaction
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implements a flawlessly smooth scroll experience (their namesake **Locomotive Scroll** or its evolution).
- **Cinematic Pacing**: The site feels like a high-end sports documentary. Pacing is controlled through scroll triggers and timed reveals.
- **Hover States**: Subtle but high-quality hover effects on links and interactive summaries.
- **Micro-interactions**: The "Play" button for the showreel and the navigation between years have satisfying, responsive feedback.
- **Performance**: Despite the video and high-end animations, the site is exceptionally fast, likely due to a modern, lightweight tech stack (Astro/Next.js).

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Framework**: **Astro** (confirmed by file paths in the page source). Used for its superior performance and ability to deliver zero-JS by default.
- **Animation**: **GSAP (GreenSock)** for all core motion and scroll-based triggers.
- **Smooth Scroll**: **Locomotive Scroll v5** or **Lenis**.
- **Video Optimization**: Uses highly compressed, high-resolution WebP/WebM formats for background visuals to maintain 60fps performance.
- **Deployment**: Likely **Vercel** or **Netlify** for edge delivery.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **Performance as a Feature**: Using a framework like Astro to achieve "Site of the Year" level visuals with "Developer Award" level performance.
2. **Thematic Consistency**: Every element (colors, type, video) reinforces the "Dynasty/Gold Standard" theme.
3. **Data as Art**: Turning simple statistics (award counts) into a compelling visual narrative.
4. **Cinematic Intro**: A high-impact video background sets the tone immediately without overwhelming the browser.
