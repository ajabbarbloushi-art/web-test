# Site 16: Mino Works

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://minoworks.com/](https://minoworks.com/) (Historical/Portfolio)
- **Award**: Honorable Mention (Jan 10, 2026)
- **Agency**: Mino
- **Core Concept**: A bold, dynamic global showcase for an innovation studio that specializes in elevating architecture and real-estate projects. It uses striking visual storytelling and a high-contrast aesthetic to position the studio as a leader in digital innovation.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Ultra-high contrast (Black & White). The site uses a pure #000000 and #FFFFFF palette to create a sense of absolute clarity and modern sophistication.
- **Dynamic Storytelling**: The site is designed as a "showcase" that guides the user through the studio's philosophy and projects using a vertical scrollytelling format.
- **Innovation-Focused UX**: The interface feels like a digital laboratory, with precise, grid-based layouts and "technical" UI elements that reinforce the studio's "innovation" positioning.
- **Bold Typography**: Uses large, impactful sans-serif headings that dominate the viewport, creating a strong brand presence.

## Animation & Interaction
- **Sophisticated Preloading**: Includes a signature preloading sequence that establishes the brand's visual language before the content even loads.
- **Vertical Scroll Transitions**: Uses a custom vertical scroll implementation that feels "weighted" and deliberate, enhancing the storytelling experience.
- **Interactive 404 Page**: Even the "Page Not Found" experience is highly designed and interactive, turning a negative UX moment into a brand-building opportunity.
- **Kinetic Footer**: A massive, animated footer that serves as a final "impact" moment before the user leaves or contacts the studio.
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle but precise animations on services and about sections that provide a sense of discovery as the user interacts.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Framework**: **Framer** (High-end Framer site pushing the boundaries of the platform).
- **Design**: **Figma** for the initial high-fidelity layouts and animation planning.
- **Animation**: Native Framer motion and interaction tools, supplemented by custom code for non-standard scroll effects.
- **Assets**: High-quality 3D renders and video backgrounds that are heavily optimized for fast loading.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **The Power of B&W**: Use a pure black and white palette to create a sense of timelessness and premium authority.
2. **Every Page is an Opportunity**: Turn standard pages (like 404 or Contact) into award-winning "elements" through creative design.
3. **Framer for High-End UX**: Prove that no-code/low-code platforms like Framer can deliver "Site of the Day" level experiences when pushed by expert designers.
4. **Preloading as Branding**: Use the loading time to tell a micro-story about the brand's identity.
