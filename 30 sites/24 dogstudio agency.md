## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Bold, dark, and cinematic. The site uses a lot of high-contrast visuals, large-scale typography, and dramatic 3D environments.
- **The "Dog" Mascot**: The brand is anchored by its running dog mascot, which is often rendered as a high-fidelity 3D model that reacts to user input and navigation.
- **Immersive Narrative**: The site is designed as a continuous journey, with projects presented as "worlds" that the user travels through.

## Animation & Interaction
- **Cinematic WebGL**: Famous for their high-end WebGL environments that feel like they belong in a AAA video game or a Hollywood film.
- **Interactive 3D Characters**: The 3D dog mascot is often the centerpiece of the interaction, reacting to mouse movement, scroll, and clicks with fluid, realistic animations.
- **Dynamic Lighting & Shaders**: Extensive use of real-time lighting, shadows, and complex shaders to create a sense of depth and realism that is rare on the web.
- **Seamless Camera Paths**: Navigating the site feels like being a camera operator in a film, with smooth orbits and transitions between different 3D scenes.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Core Engine**: **Three.js** and **WebGL** for the heavy-duty 3D rendering and character animation.
- **Animation**: Custom animation timelines and physics engines for character motion.
- **Optimization**: Sophisticated asset loading (using formats like **GLTF/GLB**) to ensure the complex 3D models load as quickly as possible.
- **Sound**: Integrated audio that complements the cinematic visuals and provides feedback on interactions.

## Key Inspiration Points
