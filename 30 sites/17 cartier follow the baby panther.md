# Site 17: Follow the baby panther (Cartier)

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://www.cartier.com/en-us/follow-the-panther.html](https://www.cartier.com/en-us/follow-the-panther.html) (Campaign Site)
- **Award**: Honorable Mention (Jan 8, 2026)
- **Agency**: [Merci Michel](https://www.mercimichel.com/)
- **Core Concept**: A charming, interactive "easter egg" campaign for Cartier. Users are invited to "activate" baby panthers that have sneaked onto the Cartier e-commerce site, blending high-end luxury branding with playful, interactive storytelling.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Luxury e-commerce meets playful animation. The base site is the classic, high-end Cartier interface (clean, white, refined), which is then "invaded" by the baby panthers.
- **Interactive Discovery**: The UX is based on a "hide and seek" mechanic. Users click on links or interact with elements to reveal the panthers, who then interact with the site's content.
- **Seamless Integration**: The panthers are not just overlays; they appear to "look" at the videos, "sit" on the product cards, and "play" with the UI elements, making them feel like they inhabit the site's world.
- **Campaign-Specific Navigation**: Includes a dedicated "Follow the panther" landing page that sets the stage and provides the "activation" instructions.

## Animation & Interaction
- **Character Animation**: High-quality, realistic 3D character animations of the baby panthers. They have lifelike movements (looking around, stretching, playing) that create an immediate emotional connection.
- **Context-Aware Interaction**: The panthers react to the specific content on the page. For example, a panther might track the movement in a hero video or react to a user's mouse hover.
- **Smooth Overlays**: Uses WebGL to overlay the 3D panthers onto the standard HTML/CSS e-commerce site without affecting performance or usability.
- **Playful Transitions**: Navigating the site becomes a game of seeing where the panther will appear next, turning a standard shopping experience into an event.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Core Engine**: **Three.js** for the 3D character rendering and animation.
- **Animation**: Custom animation pipelines to bring the 3D panthers to life, likely using **Blender** or **Maya** for the source animations.
- **Integration**: A custom WebGL layer that sits on top of Cartier's existing e-commerce platform (likely built on a major enterprise system like Salesforce Commerce Cloud).
- **Optimization**: Highly optimized 3D models to ensure the experience works smoothly on mobile and across various network speeds.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **Interactive Easter Eggs**: Use small, playful interactions to delight users and encourage them to explore more of the site.
2. **Character as Guide**: A mascot or character can serve as a "guide" through a site, making the navigation feel more personal and narrative.
3. **Luxury & Play**: Prove that even the most prestigious "Fortune 500" brands (like Cartier) can benefit from a sense of play and whimsy.
4. **Contextual Reaction**: Make your interactive elements "aware" of the rest of the site's content for a truly integrated experience.
