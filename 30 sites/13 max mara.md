# Site 13: Max Mara - Untamed Heroine

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://untamedheroinegame.maxmara.com/](https://untamedheroinegame.maxmara.com/)
- **Award**: Site of the Day (Jan 12, 2026)
- **Agency**: [Adoratorio Studio](https://adoratorio.studio/)
- **Core Concept**: An immersive, gamified brand experience inspired by Max Mara’s FW25 Runway Collection. It uses a "coming-of-age" story metaphor, guiding the user through a journey of growth and self-discovery to showcase the collection's themes.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Artistic, painterly, and organic. Uses a sophisticated palette of sage green (#9BA689) and tan/camel (#B98C62), mirroring the collection's colors. The design feels like a series of watercolor illustrations brought to life.
- **Gamified Narrative**: The site is structured as a 3D "game" or interactive story. Users "walk" through a world of torn pages and personal truths, making it a high-end example of scrollytelling.
- **Editorial Integration**: Fashion photography and collection details are seamlessly woven into the 3D environment, making the marketing feel like part of the art.
- **Atmospheric UI**: The user interface is minimal and integrated into the 3D world, using elegant serif typography that matches the brand's luxury positioning.

## Animation & Interaction
- **Immersive 3D Journey**: Uses a first-person or follow-camera perspective to move the user through a 3D landscape. The "walking" motion is controlled by scrolling.
- **Parallax Illustration Layers**: Watercolor-style layers move at different speeds, creating a deep, dreamlike sense of space.
- **Interactive Story Points**: Users encounter "torn pages" and interactive elements that reveal more about the collection's inspiration and the story's themes.
- **Fluid Transitions**: The shift between narrative story moments and product showcases is handled through cinematic camera movements and cross-fades.
- **Spatial Audio**: Includes a bespoke soundtrack and narration that enhances the emotional impact of the "untamed" journey.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Core Engine**: **WebGL** (via **Three.js** or a similar high-end engine) for the 3D world and interactive elements.
- **Animation**: **GSAP** for complex camera timelines and scroll-driven motion.
- **3D Assets**: Created and optimized in **Blender**, with custom shaders to achieve the watercolor/painterly look.
- **Framework**: Custom React-based setup optimized for high-performance 3D rendering.
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for spatialized sound and narration.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **Brand as Story**: Move beyond product grids by creating a narrative "world" that embodies the brand's seasonal theme.
2. **Artistic Shaders**: Use custom 3D shaders to create a unique visual style (like watercolor) that sets the site apart from standard "clean" 3D.
3. **Controlled Pacing**: Use scroll-driven 3D movement to ensure the user experiences the story at the intended pace.
4. **Emotional Soundscapes**: Use professional narration and spatial audio to turn a website visit into a cinematic experience.
