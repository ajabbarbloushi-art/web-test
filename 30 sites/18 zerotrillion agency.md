# Site 18: Zerotrillion Agency

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://zerotrillion.com/](https://zerotrillion.com/)
- **Award**: Honorable Mention (Jan 8, 2026)
- **Agency**: Zerotrillion
- **Core Concept**: A high-end, global creative agency website that focuses on "ambition" and "outdreaming" the competition. It uses a cinematic, narrative-driven approach to showcase the agency's work across New York, Amsterdam, and Toronto.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Dark, cinematic, and high-fashion. The site uses large-scale imagery and video backgrounds to create a "mood" of luxury and creative intensity.
- **Narrative Hero Section**: The homepage features a bold "OR" centerpiece that forces the user to choose between different creative paths, establishing the agency's "un-middle" philosophy.
- **Minimalist Navigation**: A clean, transparent navigation bar that stays out of the way of the cinematic content, using elegant sans-serif typography.
- **Location-Based Focus**: Clearly highlights the agency's global footprint (NY, Amsterdam, Toronto) through a dedicated, stylized section.

## Animation & Interaction
- **Cinematic Transitions**: Uses fluid, WebGL-driven transitions between sections that feel like a film edit.
- **Parallax Imagery**: Subtle parallax effects on large-scale photos and videos, adding depth and a sense of "premium" quality to the scroll.
- **Interactive Canvas Elements**: Includes a custom p5.js or WebGL canvas that reacts to mouse movement, creating a sense of creative "energy" on the page.
- **Kinetic Typography**: Large, bold headings that transition or reveal themselves with a weighted, high-end feel.
- **Weighted Scrolling**: Uses a custom smooth scroll implementation to ensure the cinematic content is paced correctly.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Framework**: **Next.js** for the core application structure and SEO.
- **Animation**: **GSAP** for the master timelines and complex transitions.
- **3D/Canvas**: **p5.js** or **Three.js** for the interactive canvas elements and WebGL effects.
- **Smooth Scroll**: **Lenis** or a similar high-performance smooth scroll library.
- **Video Optimization**: Advanced video compression and lazy-loading to ensure the cinematic experience doesn't sacrifice performance.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **Ambition as a Vibe**: Use cinematic visuals and bold copy to establish a "Fortune 500" level of creative ambition.
2. **Interactive Choices**: Use a "choice" or "path" mechanic (like the "OR" hero) to engage users immediately and reinforce the brand's philosophy.
3. **Cinematic Pacing**: Treat the website like a film, using transitions and smooth scrolling to control the emotional journey.
4. **Global Authority**: Clearly and stylishly highlight your global presence to build immediate trust with large-scale clients.
