# Site 22: Resn Agency

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://resn.co.nz/](https://resn.co.nz/)
- **Award**: Multiple SOTY, SOTM, and over 60 SOTD winners.
- **Agency**: Resn
- **Core Concept**: A legendary digital agency known for its "un-middle" creativity and technical excellence. Their portfolio is a playground of abstract WebGL and interactive experiments that challenge traditional UX norms.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Dark, mysterious, and abstract. The site often centers around a single, highly-complex 3D object or "monolith" that serves as the primary navigation and interaction point.
- **Experimental Navigation**: Resn is famous for rejecting standard menus. Instead, they use interactive 3D environments where projects are discovered through "play" and exploration.
- **Minimalist, Elegant UI**: When UI elements do appear, they are razor-sharp, often using ultra-thin lines and minimalist typography that feels like a high-end luxury brand.
- **Cinematic Soundscapes**: Deeply integrated audio that reacts to every user action, creating a full sensory experience that feels like a high-budget film.

## Animation & Interaction
- **Advanced 3D Geometry**: Uses complex, morphing 3D shapes that react to mouse movement and scroll with a level of fluidity that is rarely seen on the web.
- **Haptic-like Feedback**: Every interaction has a visual and auditory "weight" to it, making the digital experience feel physical and tactile.
- **Custom Shaders**: Extensive use of GLSL shaders to create unique visual effects like chromatic aberration, liquid distortion, and organic textures.
- **Surprising Transitions**: Navigating to a project often involves a dramatic, cinematic transition that "pulls" the user into a new world.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Core Engine**: **Three.js** and **WebGL** for the heavy-duty 3D rendering.
- **Animation**: Custom animation timelines and physics engines to achieve their signature "weighted" feel.
- **Optimization**: Highly sophisticated loading and asset management to ensure the complex 3D scenes run smoothly on all devices.
- **Sound**: Advanced Web Audio API implementations for real-time, reactive sound design.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **Challenge the Norm**: Don't be afraid to reject standard UX patterns if it helps tell a more compelling and unique brand story.
2. **Interactive Art as Portfolio**: Treat your portfolio as a piece of interactive art that demonstrates your creative philosophy before your work does.
3. **The Power of Sound**: Invest heavily in sound design to make your digital experiences feel "real" and emotionally impactful.
4. **Technical Fearlessness**: Use the most advanced web technologies (WebGL, Shaders, Web Audio) to create experiences that your competition simply cannot replicate.
