# Site 11: Shopify Live Globe 2025

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://bfcm.shopify.com/](https://bfcm.shopify.com/)
- **Award**: Site of the Day (Jan 19, 2026)
- **Agency**: Shopify Design
- **Core Concept**: A high-performance, real-time data visualization experience that tracks global commerce during Shopify's peak Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend. It combines data transparency with immersive gaming and WebXR.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Retro-futuristic "Mission Control" aesthetic. Uses a dark environment with neon green (#9DC44D) and orange (#F49F46) accents, reminiscent of vintage computer terminals and dot-matrix displays.
- **3D Immersion**: The central feature is a massive, interactive 3D globe that visualizes sales data as light pulses across the planet.
- **Interactive Scenes**: Beyond the globe, the site includes an "Interactive Desktop" scene where users can explore behind-the-scenes content and live infrastructure stats in a stylized 3D environment.
- **Cross-Platform Gaming**: Includes a fully playable Pinball game that works seamlessly across desktop, mobile, and even VR (WebXR).

## Animation & Interaction
- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Fluid, WebGL-driven pulses on the globe that represent actual sales data.
- **Interactive Menu Scene**: A 3D-spatial menu where navigation involves moving through a physical-feeling 3D room.
- **Dot Matrix Shaders**: Custom shaders that create a retro "dot-matrix" effect for data displays, adding to the mission-control vibe.
- **WebXR Integration**: One of the few major brand sites to offer a full WebXR experience, allowing users to play the pinball game in their own physical space.
- **Kinetic Typography**: Large, bold headings that transition with a mechanical, high-tech feel.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Core Engine**: **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber (R3F)** for the complex 3D scenes and globe.
- **Animation**: **GSAP** for UI transitions and **React Spring** for physics-based 3D interactions.
- **Shaders**: Custom **GLSL** shaders for the dot-matrix effects and data pulses.
- **Framework**: **Next.js** / **React** for the application structure.
- **Immersion**: **WebXR API** for the VR/AR components.
- **Real-time**: WebSockets or high-frequency polling for the live data feed.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **Data as Entertainment**: Turn dry infrastructure and sales stats into a beautiful, interactive "spectacle."
2. **Multi-Sensory Storytelling**: Combine 3D visuals, retro aesthetics, and spatial audio to create a complete "world."
3. **Cutting-Edge Tech Adoption**: Use WebXR and advanced shaders to prove the brand is at the forefront of web technology.
4. **Gamified Engagement**: Use a high-quality mini-game (Pinball) to increase time-on-site and social sharing.
