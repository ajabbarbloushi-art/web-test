# Site 2: Jesper Landberg Portfolio

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://jesperlandberg.com/](https://jesperlandberg.com/)
- **Award**: Independent of the Year 2024, Multiple SOTD & Developer Awards
- **Developer**: Jesper Landberg (Independent)
- **Core Concept**: A ultra-minimalist, typography-centric "Selected Index" that serves as a portal to a vast body of high-end creative development work.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: Brutalist minimalism. Heavy focus on Swiss-style typography (likely a custom or refined grotesque face). The site is essentially a list of projects with zero visual clutter.
- **Hero Section**: Simple text-based header: "Jesper Landberg - Independent Creative Developer - Selected Index (25)".
- **Navigation**: No traditional nav bar. The site is a single-page index. Social links and contact info are at the bottom.
- **Contrast**: Extreme high contrast (Black on White).

## Animation & Interaction
- **Micro-interactions**: The magic is in the hover states. Each project link triggers a sophisticated WebGL-based image reveal or distortion effect (based on his previous work).
- **Typography Animation**: Smooth, high-performance text reveals and transitions.
- **Feel**: "Smooth as butter" (as noted in Awwwards case studies). The site uses a custom smooth scroll implementation to ensure all motion feels fluid and premium.
- **Performance**: Extremely lightweight. The initial load is nearly instantaneous, with heavy assets (WebGL/Images) loaded on-demand or as part of the interaction.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Core Engine**: **Vanilla JavaScript** & **WebGL**. Jesper is known for "hand-rolling" many of his tools rather than relying on heavy frameworks.
- **Animation**: **GSAP (GreenSock)** is his primary tool for all motion timelines and complex transitions.
- **Smooth Scroll**: Custom-built or a highly modified version of **Lenis**.
- **WebGL Framework**: Likely **Curtains.js** or a custom lightweight wrapper for WebGL image effects.
- **Framework**: Often uses **Next.js** for client projects, but his personal site is a masterclass in lightweight, vanilla-first development.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **The Power of Less**: When your work is top-tier, the portfolio itself can be a simple, perfectly executed index.
2. **Typography as Hero**: If the type is perfect, you don't need a hero image.
3. **Interactive Reveal**: Use WebGL not just for 3D scenes, but to add "eye candy" to simple interactions like hovering over a link.
4. **Performance is UX**: A site that loads and responds instantly feels more "premium" than one with heavy loading screens.
