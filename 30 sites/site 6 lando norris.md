# Site 6: Lando Norris Official Website

## Overview
- **URL**: [https://landonorris.com/](https://landonorris.com/)
- **Award**: Site of the Month (Awwwards)
- **Agency**: [OFF+BRAND](https://offbrand.agency/)
- **Core Concept**: A high-energy, immersive fan experience for F1 driver Lando Norris, combining 3D product visualization (helmets) with cinematic storytelling and high-performance interactivity.

## Design & UI/UX
- **Visual Style**: High-contrast, vibrant, and "Racing" aesthetic. Uses Lando's signature fluorescent yellow/green as the primary brand color against a dark, technical background.
- **Hero Section**: Immersive WebGL experience featuring a 3D helmet that users can interact with immediately.
- **Typography**: Bold, wide grotesques that evoke speed and modern racing branding.
- **Navigation**: Uses a non-standard, experiential navigation system that guides users through "On Track" (career) and "Off Track" (lifestyle/commercial) content.

## Animation & Interaction
- **3D Helmet Hall of Fame**: A signature feature using WebGL/Three.js to showcase Lando's helmet designs across different seasons. Users can rotate and examine the helmets in high detail.
- **Kinetic Typography**: Text elements react to scroll and mouse movement, creating a sense of constant motion and energy.
- **Parallax Layers**: Sophisticated use of depth, with photography, 3D assets, and UI elements moving at different speeds to create an immersive "cockpit" feel.
- **Micro-interactions**: High-quality hover effects on social links and menu items, using SVG distortions and color shifts.

## Technical Stack & Tools
- **Core Engine**: **Three.js** & **WebGL** for the 3D helmet visualization and interactive backgrounds.
- **Animation**: **GSAP (GreenSock)** for all timeline-based reveals and complex scroll triggers.
- **Smooth Scroll**: **Lenis** for high-performance, unified scroll behavior across devices.
- **Framework**: **Next.js** or a similar high-performance React-based framework (optimized for static generation).
- **Shaders**: Custom GLSL shaders for the liquid-like background effects and helmet material reflections.

## Key Inspiration Points
1. **Interactive 3D as Content**: Turn a product list (helmets) into an interactive 3D gallery that users *want* to play with.
2. **Brand-First Color Theory**: Use a single, high-vibrancy color (fluorescent yellow) to create a memorable and consistent visual identity.
3. **Speed & Energy**: Convey the core essence of the brand (F1 racing) through kinetic typography and fast-paced (but controlled) animations.
4. ** experiential Navigation**: Move away from standard headers/footers to create a more "game-like" discovery process.
